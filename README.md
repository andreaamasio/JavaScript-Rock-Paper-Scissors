# JavaScript-Rock 🪨 Paper 📄 Scissors ✂️ Game 🎮
I built rock paper scissors game with Javascript. The game get user input and compare with random choice of computer. This is done for 5 rounds. Each round user get confirmation of scores and who won the round. At the end the final winner is declared, and it is possible to restart the game 🎮. Enjoy!
