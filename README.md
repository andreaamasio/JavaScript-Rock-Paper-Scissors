# JavaScript-Rock 🪨 Paper 📄 Scissors ✂️ Game 🎮
I built rock paper scissors game with Javascript. The game get user input through buttons and compare with random choice of computer. This is done until player or computer reach score of 5. Each round user get confirmation of scores and who won the round. At the end the final winner is declared, and buttons stop checking for inputs 🎮. Enjoy!
